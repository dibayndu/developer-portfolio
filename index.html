            <p>A practical joke, or prank, is a mischievous trick played on someone, generally causing the victim to
                experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort.A person who performs a practical joke is
                called a "practical joker" or "prankster".Other terms for practical jokes include gag, rib, jape, or
                shenanigan.

                Practical jokes differ from confidence tricks or hoaxes in that the victim finds out, or is let in on
                the
                joke, rather than being talked into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes are generally
                lighthearted and without lasting effect; they aim to make the victim feel humbled or foolish, but not
                victimized or humiliated. Thus most practical jokes are affectionate gestures of humour and designed to
                encourage laughter. However, practical jokes performed with cruelty can constitute bullying, whose
                intent is
                to harass or exclude rather than reinforce social bonds through ritual humbling.

                Some countries in Western culture traditionally emphasize the carrying out of practical jokes on April
                Fools' Day.</p>
